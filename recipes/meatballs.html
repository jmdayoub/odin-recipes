<h3>How to make the best Italian meatballs</h3>

<p>After having made who knows how many millions of meatballs in my life, 
  I’ve officially landed on this easy meatball recipe as my forever favorite. 
  And I love it for so many reasons.</p>

<p>Mainly, I’m partial to this particular meatball recipe because it is BIG 
  on flavor. I’ve always considered it such a missed opportunity when I’m 
  served meatballs that are bland and boring because, quite frankly, it’s so 
  easy to make them delicious! We shouldn’t have to rely on a sauce to make 
  meatballs interesting. So this recipe goes big on all of my favorite flavors, 
  including a base mix of ground beef and pork (win-win), classic garlic and 
  onion (grated to avoid chunks), lots of Parmesan (adds amazing flavor), and 
  a generous helping of zesty herbs and seasonings.</p>

<p>Basically, this is the meatball recipe that I use for pretty much everything
   and it is always, always a winner. So be sure to bookmark this one, and let’s
   make a batch together!</p>
