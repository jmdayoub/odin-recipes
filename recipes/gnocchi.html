<p>Love potato gnocchi? Allow me to introduce you to its quicker-and-easier-to-make, 
  ultra-light-and-pillowy, arguably-even-more-delicious cousin…</p>

<p>Bottom line — whether you’re a beginner with making your own homemade gnocchi, 
  or if you’re a potato gnocchi pro and are just looking for a quicker method, I 
  highly recommend giving the ricotta version a try. I think you’re going to love

</ul>
